## Customer Churn Analysis

### Introduction
Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. Companies that can reduce customer churn will be more profitable and have a better reputation. Therefore, it is important to analyze the data and predict which customers are likely to churn.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and predict which customers are likely to churn.

### Data
The data is from a telecommunications company. It includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic
- Customers who are still customers

### Methods
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

### Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask

### Conclusion
The model was able to predict customer churn with an accuracy of approximately 80%.
